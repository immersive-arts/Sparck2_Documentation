# Contributing

SPARCK is an actively maintained and constantly evolving project serving a diverse user base with versatile backgrounds and needs. 

We encourage our community to open new issues and discussions, evolving our [issue tracker] and
[discussion board] into a knowledge base – an important addition to our [documentation] – yielding value to both new and experienced users.

  [discussion board]: https://github.com/immersive-arts/Sparck2/discussions
  [issue tracker]: https://github.com/immersive-arts/Sparck2/issues
  [documentation]: https://github.com/immersive-arts/Sparck2_Documentation

## How you can contribute

We understand that reporting bugs, raising change requests, as well as engaging
in discussions can be time-consuming, which is why we've carefully optimized our
issue templates and defined guidelines to improve the overall interaction
within the project. We've invested a lot of time and effort into making our
[issue tracker] and [discussion board] as efficient as possible.

Our goal is to ensure that our documentation, as well as issue tracker and
discussion board, are __well-structured__, __easy to navigate__, and
__searchable__, so you can find what you need quickly and efficiently. Thus,
when you follow our guidelines, we can help you much faster.

In this section, we guide your through our processes.
