# Introduction

SPARCK (SPatial Augmented Reality Construction Kit) is a [Max](https://cycling74.com/) [Package](https://docs.cycling74.com/userguide/packages/) for building spatial augmented projection setups.

It follows a similar approach to [VIZZIE](https://cycling74.com/packages/vizzie), providing a collection of [abstractions](https://docs.cycling74.com/userguide/abstractions/) — called **Nodes** in SPARCK — that let you build complex projection workflows with only a few building blocks.

## Who is this for?

SPARCK is designed for artists, designers, and technologists working with projection mapping, spatial augmented reality, and immersive installations. Whether you're mapping onto architectural surfaces, creating interactive exhibits, or building multi-projector setups, SPARCK provides the tools to realize your vision.

## Next Steps

!!! note "Prerequisites"
    You should be comfortable with:
    
    - Basic Max patching (objects, patch cords, subpatchers)
    - Opening context menus and adding abstractions
    - Basic Jitter rendering (optional but helpful)
