# What is SPARCK?

SPARCK (SPatial Augmented Reality Construction Kit) is a [Max](https://cycling74.com/) [Package](https://docs.cycling74.com/userguide/packages/) for building spatial augmented projection setups.

It follows a similar approach to [VIZZIE](https://cycling74.com/packages/vizzie), providing a collection of [abstractions](https://docs.cycling74.com/userguide/abstractions/) — called **Nodes** in SPARCK — that let you build complex projection workflows with only a few building blocks.

## Who is this for?

SPARCK is designed for artists, designers, and technologists working with projection mapping, spatial augmented reality, and immersive installations. Whether you're mapping onto architectural surfaces, creating interactive exhibits, or building multi-projector setups, SPARCK provides the tools to realize your vision.

!!! note "Prerequisites"
    You should be comfortable with:
    
    - Basic Max patching (objects, patch cords, subpatchers)
    - Opening context menus and adding abstractions
    - Basic Jitter rendering (optional but helpful)

## Key Features

- **Node-based workflow**: Build complex setups by connecting visual building blocks
- **Integrated project management**: Automatic folder structure keeps your assets organized
- **Multiple projector support**: Manage up to 96 outputs across 4 windows
- **3D scene rendering**: Place and transform content in 3D space
- **Flexible camera system**: Multiple camera types for different projection scenarios
- **Shader pipeline**: Apply visual effects with chainable shader nodes
- **Scripting support**: Automate your setup with QueScript
