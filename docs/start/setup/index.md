# Getting started with SPARCK
Getting started with SPARCK is straightforward once your system is equipped with the required tools. This page guides you through preparing your environment to installing SPARCK.

Before you continue, make sure to follow these two steps:<br>
- [Prepare your system](https://immersive-arts.github.io/Sparck2_Documentation/start/setup/prerequisites/) — install Max, Java, and optional tools needed for SPARCK to run smoothly.<br>
- [Install SPARCK](https://immersive-arts.github.io/Sparck2_Documentation/start/setup/installation/) — download the package, set up dependencies, and launch SPARCK for the first time.

Once both steps are complete, you’ll be ready to explore SPARCK’s 3D, node-based workflow and start building interactive spatial experiences.
