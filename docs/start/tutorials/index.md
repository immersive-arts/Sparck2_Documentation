# Tutorials
This collection of tutorials provides a practical entry point into working with SPARCK. Each guide focuses on key aspects of the workflow — from initial setup and calibration to creating spatial augmented reality scenes and projection-based installations.

- [Getting Started](01_Getting_Started/Getting_Started.md) shows how to begin any SPARCK project, including how to add the SPARCK App inside a Max patch.<br>
- [Calibration](02_Calibration/calibration.md) explains how to calibrate four projectors for a Spatial Augmented Reality setup.<br>
- [Wall Projection](04_Wall_Projection/Wall_Projection.md) shows how to set up a wall projection using a single projector.<br>
- [Floor Projection](05_Floor_Projection/Floor_Projection.md) shows how to set up a floor projection using two projectors.
- [Spatial Augmented Reality](03_Spatial_Augmented_Reality/Spatial_Aumented_Reality.md) demonstrates how to create a SPARCK project for Spatial Augmented Reality, in which tracked moving objects are dynamically projected onto.<br>
