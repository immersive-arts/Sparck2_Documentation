The following are Project Example you can download and experiment with:

## Basics

<div class="card" markdown>
### BASIC_01_Castle
![](images/BASIC_01_Castle.png)
Using the [MeshWarp]{data-preview} Node to output three custom meshes to three different projectors by splitting an [Window]{ data-preview } window into three [Viewport]{ data-preview }
</div>

<div class="card" markdown>
### BASIC_02_Signage
![](images/BASIC_02_Signage.png)
Using the [MeshWarp]{ data-preview } Node to output eight custom meshes to eight different monitors by splitting an [Window]{ data-preview } window into eight [Viewport]{ data-preview }
</div>

<div class="card" markdown>
### BASIC_03_Cornerpin
![](images/BASIC_03_Cornerpin.png)
Using the [CornerPin]{ data-preview } Node to output 9 custom cornerpin to one monitor via one [Window]{ data-preview } window
</div>

## Master

<div class="grid" markdown>

<div class="card" markdown>
### MASTER_01_IMLab
![](images/MASTER_01_IMLab.png)
Using the [Beamer]{ data-preview } Node to output four calibrated renderpasses to four different projectors by splitting an [Window]{ data-preview } window into four [Viewport]{ data-preview }. The content projected onto the screen is generated by a [ShaderRaymarcher]{ data-preview } object. The [BoxMapCamera]{ data-preview } is used to indicated the ray origin for the Shader.

### MASTER_02_Dodecaedron
![](images/MASTER_02_Dodecaedron.png)
Using the [Beamer]{ data-preview } Node to output three calibrated renderpasses to three different projectors by splitting an [Window]{ data-preview } window into three [Viewport]{ data-preview }. Each Output has a render pipline that uses a calibrated [Beamer]{ data-preview } node that renders the [Canvas]{ data-preview } nodes connected to the [Video]{ data-preview } node. A second render pass is recorded by a [SceneCapture]{ data-preview } node, which renders its own [Canvas]{ data-preview } node (which in turn shares its transformation with the Canvas node that is recorded be the Beamers), but only with a manual render pass. this render pass is used in combination with a [ShdrTexOP]{ data-preview }, that uses it as a mask. The shader is applied inside the [Viewport]{ data-preview }, together with a [MeshWarp]{ data-preview } node that allows small mapping corrections.

### MASTER_03_AnaglyphStereo
![](images/MASTER_03_AnaglyphStereo.png)
Illustrates how to use [SceneCamera]{ data-preview } in stereo mode to render the same scene in two renderpasses from slightly different angles to get a stereoscopic effect. Two [Window]{ data-preview } to show both the individual render passes and the final result. Using the [ShaderAnaglyph]{ data-preview } to render the two passes into one texture to be viewed with an anaglyph spectacles. [QueScript]{ data-preview } animates the Gazebo to do a slow rotation.

## Pro

<div class="card" markdown>
### PRO_01_DevilsStone
![](images/PRO_01_DevilsStone.png)
Using the [Beamer]{ data-preview } Node to output four calibrated render pipelines to four different projectors by splitting a [Window]{ data-preview } into four [Viewport]{ data-preview }. Each render pipeline uses a calibrated [Beamer]{ data-preview } and linked [SceneCapture]{ data-preview } node to create two renderpasses each: one for the content and the other for the blend-mask, generated by the [SpatialShadery]{ data-preview }node. The [BlendSoftedge]{ data-preview } blends the content pass and the blend-mask inside the [Viewport]{ data-preview } before it is sent to the projectors.
</div>

<div class="card" markdown>
### PRO_02_Dome
![](images/PRO_02_Dome.png)
Using Six calibrated render pipelines to six different projectors by splitting a [Window]{ data-preview } into six [Viewport]{ data-preview }. Each render pipeline uses a calibrated [Beamer]{ data-preview } node: In combination of the [SpatialShadery]{ data-preview } node  settings 'edgeAndBlend' and 'baked texture', the content from the [Video]{ data-preview } and the realtime generated and baked blend-mask are blended in one pass and then sent as is to [Viewport]{ data-preview } nodes.
</div>

### PRO_03_SPatialAR
![](images/PRO_03_SPatialAR.png)
A Barebones Spatial Augmented Reality Setup. Three calibrated render pipelines play on three different projectors by splitting a [Window]{ data-preview } into three [Viewport]{ data-preview }. Each render pipeline uses a calibrated [Beamer]{ data-preview } node. No [SpatialShadery]{ data-preview } nodes are used in this setup to keep the patch simple. The content projected on the head [Canvas]{ data-preview } is recorded in a primary render pass by a [SceneCapture]{ data-preview } and then reprojected on the head from the same point with a [TextureProjectury]{ data-preview } node. A similar setup is used for the background surface. The animations are played back a [QueScript]{ data-preview } and multiple transformation trees and with a [TfmLookAt]{ data-preview } node it is made sure that the [SceneCamera]{ data-preview } always points at the correct place.
