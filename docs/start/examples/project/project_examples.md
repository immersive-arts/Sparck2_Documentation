# Project Examples

The following are Project Example you can download and experiment with:

## Basics

<div class="card" markdown>
### BASIC_01_Castle
![](images/BASIC_01_Castle.png)
Using the [MeshWarp] Node to output three custom meshes to three different projectors by splitting an [Window] window into three [Viewport]
</div>

<div class="card" markdown>
### BASIC_02_Signage
![](images/BASIC_02_Signage.png)
Using the [MeshWarp] Node to output eight custom meshes to eight different monitors by splitting an [Window] window into eight [Viewport]
</div>

### BASIC_03_Cornerpin
![](images/BASIC_03_Cornerpin.png)
Using the [CornerPin] Node to output 9 custom cornerpin to one monitor via one [Window] window
</div>

## Master

<div class="grid" markdown>

<div class="card" markdown>
### MASTER_01_IMLab
![](images/MASTER_01_IMLab.png)
Using the [Beamer] Node to output four calibrated renderpasses to four different projectors by splitting an [Window] window into four [Viewport]. The content projected onto the screen is generated by a [ShaderRayMarcher] object. The [BoxMapCamera] is used to indicated the ray origin for the Shader.

### MASTER_02_Dodecaedron
![](images/MASTER_02_Dodecaedron.png)
Using the [Beamer] Node to output three calibrated renderpasses to three different projectors by splitting an [Window] window into three [Viewport]. Each Output has a render pipline that uses a calibrated [Beamer] node that renders the [Canvas] nodes connected to the [Video] node. A second render pass is recorded by a [SceneCapture] node, which renders its own [Canvas] node (which in turn shares its transformation with the Canvas node that is recorded be the Beamers), but only with a manual render pass. this render pass is used in combination with a [ShdrTexOP], that uses it as a mask. The shader is applied inside the [Viewport], together with a [MeshWarp] node that allows small mapping corrections.

<div class="card" markdown>
### MASTER_03_AnaglyphStereo
![](images/MASTER_03_AnaglyphStereo.png)
Illustrates how to use [SceneCamera] in stereo mode to render the same scene in two renderpasses from slightly different angles to get a stereoscopic effect. Two [Window] to show both the individual render passes and the final result. Using the [ShaderAnaglyph] to render the two passes into one texture to be viewed with an anaglyph spectacles. [QueScript] animates the Gazebo to do a slow rotation.

## Pro

<div class="grid" markdown>

<div class="card" markdown>
### PRO_01_DevilsStone
![](images/PRO_01_DevilsStone.png)
Using the [Beamer] Node to output four calibrated render pipelines to four different projectors by splitting a [Window] into four [Viewport]. Each render pipeline uses a calibrated [Beamer] and linked [SceneCapture] node to create two renderpasses each: one for the content and the other for the blend-mask, generated by the [SpatialShadery] node. The [BlendSoftedge] blends the content pass and the blend-mask inside the [Viewport] before it is sent to the projectors.
</div>

<div class="card" markdown>
### PRO_02_Dome
![](images/PRO_02_Dome.png)
Using Six calibrated render pipelines to six different projectors by splitting a [Window] into six [Viewport]. Each render pipeline uses a calibrated [Beamer] node: In combination of the [SpatialShadery] node  settings 'edgeAndBlend' and 'baked texture', the content from the [Video] and the realtime generated and baked blend-mask are blended in one pass and then sent as is to [Viewport] nodes.
</div>

### PRO_03_SPatialAR
![](images/PRO_03_SPatialAR.png)
A Barebones Spatial Augmented Reality Setup. Three calibrated render pipelines play on three different projectors by splitting a [Window] into three [Viewport]. Each render pipeline uses a calibrated [Beamer] node. No [SpatialShadery] nodes are used in this setup to keep the patch simple. The content projected on the head [Canvas] is recorded in a primary render pass by a [SceneCapture] and then reprojected on the head from the same point with a [TextureProjectury] node. A similar setup is used for the background surface. The animations are played back a [QueScript] and multiple transformation trees and with a [TfmNodeLookAt] node it is made sure that the [SceneCamera] alway point at the correct place.
