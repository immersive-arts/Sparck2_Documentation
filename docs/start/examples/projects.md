# Example Projects

The following are Example Projects you can download and experiment with:

## Basics

<div class="grid" markdown>

<div class="card" markdown>
### BASIC_01_Castle
![](../../assets/images/examples/BASIC_01_Castle.png)
Using the [MeshWarp] Node to output three custom meshes to three different projectors by splitting an [Window] window into three [Viewport]
</div>

<div class="card" markdown>
### BASIC_02_Signage
![](../../assets/images/examples/BASIC_02_Signage.png)
Using the [MeshWarp] Node to output eight custom meshes to eight different monitors by splitting an [Window] window into eight [Viewport]
</div>

<div class="card" markdown>
### BASIC_03_Cornerpin
![](../../assets/images/examples/BASIC_03_Cornerpin.png)
Using the [CornerPin] Node to output 9 custom cornerpin to one monitor via one [Window] window
</div>

</div>

## Master

<div class="grid" markdown>

<div class="card" markdown>
### MASTER_01_IMLab
![](../../assets/images/examples/MASTER_01_IMLab.png)
Using the [Beamer] Node to output four calibrated renderpasses to four different projectors by splitting an [Window] window into four [Viewport]. The content projected onto the screen is generated by a [ShaderRaymarcher] object. The [BoxMapCamera] is used to indicated the ray origin for the Shader.
</div>

<div class="card" markdown>
### MASTER_02_Dodecaedron
![](../../assets/images/examples/MASTER_02_Dodecaedron.png)
Using the [Beamer] Node to output three calibrated renderpasses to three different projectors by splitting an [Window] window into three [Viewport]. Each Output has a render pipline that uses a calibrated [Beamer] node that renders the [Canvas] nodes connected to the [Video] node. A second render pass is recorded by a [SceneCapture] node, which renders its own [Canvas] node (which in turn shares its transformation with the Canvas node that is recorded be the Beamers), but only with a manual render pass. this render pass is used in combination with a [ShdrTexOP], that uses it as a mask. The shader is applied inside the [Viewport], together with a [MeshWarp] node that allows small mapping corrections.
</div>

<div class="card" markdown>
### MASTER_03_AnaglyphStereo
![](../../assets/images/examples/MASTER_03_AnaglyphStereo.png)
Illustrates how to use [SceneCamera] in stereo mode to render the same scene in two renderpasses from slightly different angles to get a stereoscopic effect. Two [Window] to show both the individual render passes and the final result. Using the [ShaderAnaglyph] to render the two passes into one texture to be viewed with an anaglyph spectacles. [QueScript] animates the Gazebo to do a slow rotation.
